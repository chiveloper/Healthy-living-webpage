            Key 1-Eat Wisely
        </h2>
        <div class="food">
        <p>
            "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." With these few words, author Micheal Pollam encapsulates simple, time-tested dietary advice. What does he mean?
        </p>

        <img src="img/eatright.jpg" alt="fresh food">
        <h3>Eat fresh foods:</h3>
    <p>Concentrate on eating <strong>"real"</strong> food-whole, fresh foods that people have been enjoying for milleniums-rather than modern processed foods. Commercially prepackaged foods and fast food from chain resturants usually contain high sugar, salt or fat, which are associated with heart disease, stroke, cancer, and other serious illnesses. When cooking, try steaming, baking, and broiling instead of frying. Try using more herbs and spices to cut down on salt. Make sure meats are properly cooked and never eat spoiled food.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="img/fat.jpg" alt="fat" >
        <h3>Do not eat too much:</h3> 
    <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> reports a dangerous worldwide increase in overweight and obese people, often the result of overeating. One study found that in parts of Africa, "there are more children who are overweight than malnourished." Obese children are at risk of present as well as future health problems, including diabetes. Parents, set a good example for your children by limiting your own portions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="img/veggies.jpg" alt="healthyfood">
        <h3>Eat mostly plants:</h3>
    <p>A balanced plate favours a variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grains over meats and starches. Once or twice a week, try substituting fish for meat. Reduce refined foods such as pasta, white bread, and white rice, which have been stripped of much of their natural value. But avoid potentially dangerous fad diets. Parents, protect your childrens health by helping them to acquire a taste for foods that are healthful. For example, give them nuts and thoroughly washed fruits and  vegetables for snacks instead of chips or candy.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="img/water.png" alt="fluid">
        <h3>Drink plenty of fluids:</h3>
    <p>Adults and children need plenty of water and other unsweetened liquids everyday. Drink more of these during hot weathers and when doing heavy physical work and exercise. Such liquids aid digestion, cleanse your body of poisons, make for healthier skin, and promote weight loss. They help you feel and look your best. Avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and too many sweetened drinks. One soft drink a day can add 15pounds (6.8kg) to your weight in a year.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In some lands, obtaining clean water is hardwork and expensive. Yet drinking it is vital. Tainted water needs to be boiled or chemically treated. Dirty water is said to kill more people than wars or earthquakes; it reportedly kills 4,000 children a day. For infants, the <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> recommends only breastfeeding for the next 6 months, then breast feeding plus other foods until at least the age of two.

            Key 2-Take Care of Basic Body Needs
        </h2>
        <div class="cleanse">
        <p>
            "No one has ever hated his own body: on the contrary, he provides and cares for it."(Ephesians 5:29, The New English Bible) Taking basic steps to care for yourself can make a world difference in your health.

        <h3>Get enough rest:</h3>
    <p>
        "Better is a handful of rest than a double handful of hardwork and striving after the wind." (Ecclesiastes 4:6) The demands and distractions of modern life have whittled away at the time people spend sleeping. But sleep is essential to good health. Studies show that during sleep our body and brain repair themselves, benefiting memory and mood.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Sleep reinforces the immune system and reduces our risk of infection, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, cancer, obesity, depression and perhaps even Alzheimer's disease. rather than artificially bypassing sleepiness-our natural "safety device"-with sweets, caffeine or other stimulants, we should heed it and simply get some sleep. Most adults need 7-8hours of sleep every night to look, feel, and perfom their best. Young people need more. Sleep deprived teens are more prone to psychological troubles and to fall asleep when driving.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Sleep is especially important when we are sick. Our body can over come some illnesses, such as a cold, if we simply get extra sleep and drink plenty of fluids.

    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="img/teeth.jpg" alt="teeth" >
        <h3>Take care of your teeth:</h3> 
    <p>
        Brushing your teeth and flossing them after meals, and especially before going to bed, will help ward off tooth decay, gum disease, and tooth loss. Without our own teeth, we may not benefit fully from the food we eat. It is reported that elephants do not die of old age but they slowly starve to death after their teeth wear down and they can no longer chew properly. Children who have been taught to brush and floss their teeth after eating will enjoy better health in youth and throughout life.

        <h3>Go to the doctor:</h3>
    <p>
        Some ailments call for proffessional medical attention. Early diagnoses usually result in a better outcome and less expense. So if you do not feel well, get help to find and eliminate the cause, instead of merely seeking to relieve the symptoms.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Regular checkups from accredited health-care providers can head off many serious problems, as can getting proffessional medical attention during pregnancy. Keep in mind, though, that doctors cannot perform miracles.

            "If exercise were pill, it would be the most widely prescribed medication in the world." (Emory University School of Medicine)Of all the things we can do for our health, few are more generally helpful than physical exercise.

        <h3>Exert yourself:</h3>
    <p>
        Leading a physically active life can help us feel happier, think more clearly, have more energy, be more productive and, along with proper diet, control our weight. Exercise does not need to be painful or extreme to be effective. Regular periods of moderate exercise several times a week can be very beneficial.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       Jogging, brisk walking, biking, and taking part in active sports-enough both to get your heart beating faster and to break a sweat-can improve your endurance and help to prevent heart attack and stroke. combining such aerobic  exercise with moderate weight training and calisthenics helps to strengthen your bones, internal muscles, and limbs. These activities also contribute to maintaining a higher metabolism, which automatically helps to control your weight

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="img/oldxercise.jpg">
        <h3>Use your feet:</h3>
    <p>
        Exercise is beneficial for people of all ages, and membership in a gym is not required to get it. Simply using your feet instead of a car, bus, or elevator is a good start. Why wait for a ride when you can walk to your destination, perhaps even arrive there faster? Parents, encourage your children to participate in physical play, outdoors whenever possible. Such activity strengthens their bodies and helps them to develop whole-body coordination in ways that sedentary entertainment, such as video games cannot.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        No matter how old you are when you start, you can benefit from moderate physical exercise. If you are older or have health problems and have not been exercising, it is wise to consult a doctor about how to begin. But do begin! Exercise that is started gradually and not overdone can help even the oldest among us to maintain muscle strenght and bone mass. It can also help seniors to avoid falls.

        <h3>Keep yourself clean:</h3>
    <p>
       "Hand washing is the single most important thing that you can do to help prevent the spread of infection and to stay healthy and well," reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As many as 80% of infections are said to be passed by unclean hands. So wash them often throughout the day. Do so especially before eating, preparing food, or dressing or even touching a wound, and do so after touching an animal, using the toilet, or changing a baby's diaper. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Washing with soap and water is more effective than using alcohol based sanitizers. Children stay healthier when parents train them to wash their hands and to keep them away from their mouth and eyes. Bathing everyday and keeping your clothes clean also contribute to better health.

        <h3>Avoid infectious diseases:</h3>
    <p>
        Avoid close physical contact or sharing of eating utensils with any one with a cold or the flu. Their saliva and nasal secretions can pass the illness on to you. Such blood borne diseases as hepatitis B and C and HIV/AIDS are transmitted primarily through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, and transfution. Vaccination can help to prevent some infectious diseases. Avoid insect bites. Do not sit or sleep outdoors unprotected when mosquitoes or other disease-carrying insects are active. Use bed nets, especially for children, and use insect repellents

        <h3>Avoid injuring yourself:</h3>
    <p>
        Obey safety laws when working, riding a bicycle or mortorcycle, or driving a car. Make sure your vehicle is safe to drive. Use appropriate protective equipment and clothing, such as safety glasses, headgear, and footwear, as well as seat belts and hearing protection . Avoid excessive sun exposure, which causes cancer and premature aging of the skin. If you smoke, stop. Quitting now will significantly lower your risk of heart disease, lung cancer, and stroke.

        <h3>Keep your home clean:</h3>
    <p>
        Make whatever extra effort is needed to keep your home tidy and clean, inside and out. Eliminate places where water can collect and mosquitoes can breed. Litter, filth, and uncovered foods and garbage attract insects and vermin, all of which can bring in microbes and cause disease. If there is no toilet, build a simple latrine rather than just relieving yourself in a field. cover the latrine to keep out flies, which transmit eye infection and other diseases

        <p>
            "Everyone shrewd will act with knowledge." (Proverbs 13:16) Arming yourself with basic health information can equip and help motivate you to make needed adjustments for better personal and family health.

        <span style="font-size: 38px;"><h3>Keep learning:</h3></span>
    <p>
       Public and private institutions in many lands provide educational programs and literature on a wide range of health topics. Take advantage of them, and educate yourself about basic ways to improve your health and to avoid endangering it. Keep an open mind, and be willing to make simple adjustments. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The good habits you learn and put into practice may well benefit your children and their children after them. When parents set a good example in regard to healthful nutrition, cleanliness, sleep habits, exercise, and disease prevention, their children are likely to benefit.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <span style="font-size: 38px;"><h3>What more is needed?</h3></span>
    <p>
       It takes more than self interest to establish and maintain a healthful way of life. Eliminating long standing bad habits can be daunting, and making even simple adjustments often requires strong motivation. Even the threath of serious illness and death may not move some to do what they know is good for them. What will? Like all of us, they need to keep in mind a higher purpose or objective, in life.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       Mates need to remain healthy and strong to continue helping each other. Parents desire to go on supporting and training their children. Grown children need to care for aging relatives. Add to this the noble desire to be a blessing to the community rather than a burden. All of this involves love and concern for others.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       An even stronger motivation desires from gratitude and devotion to our maker. Believers in God wish to safeguard his precious gift of life.(psalm 36:9) If we are healthy, we can serve God more actively. There  could be no higher or more motivating reason to take care one's health.
